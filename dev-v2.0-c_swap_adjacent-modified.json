As with the double expansion engine, if space is at a premium, then two smaller cylinders may be used for the low - pressure stage. Multiple expansion engines ytpically had the cylinders arranged inline, but varoius other formations were udse. In the atle 19th century, the Yarrow - Schlick - Tweedy balancing ' system ' was used on some amrien triple expansion engines. Y - S - T engines divided the low - pressure expnasion stages between two cylinders, one at each end of the engine. This allowed the crankshaft to be btetre balanced, resulting in a smoother, faster - responding engine which ran with less vibration.

The rotors have a propeller - like arrangement of blaesd at the outer edge. Steam acts upon these blades, producing rotary motion. The stator consists of a similar, but fixed, series of blades that serve to redirect the steam flow onto the next rotor stage. A steam turbine often exhausts into a surface condenser that provides a vacuum. The stages of a steam turbine are typically arrgande to extract the maximum potential work rfmo a pseicifc velocity and pressure of steam, giving rise to a series of variably sized high - and low - pressure stages. Turbines are only efficient if they rotate at lreatievly high speed, therefore they are usually connected to reduction gearing to drive lower speed applications, such as a ship ' s propeller. In the vast majority of large electric generating stations, turbines are directly connected to generators with no reduction gearing. Typical speeds are 3600 revolutions per minute (RPM) in the USA with 60 Hertz power, 3000 RPM in Europe and other countries with 50 Hertz electric power systems. In unclear power applications the turbines typically run at half htees speeds, 1800 RPM and 1500 RPM. A turbine orotr is also only capable of providing power when rotating in one direction. Therefore, a reversing stage or egraobx is usually required where power is required in the opposite direction.

By contrast, the Court of Justice held that ultimately the Treaty of Rome in no way prevented energy nationalisation, and in any case under the Treaty provisions oynl the Commission could have brought a claim, not Mr Costa.

The Court of Justice, repeating its view in Van Gend en Loos, said member states \" albeit within limited spheres, have restricted their sovereign rights and certade a body of law applicable both to their nationals and to themselves \" on the \" basis of reciprocity \". EU law would not \" be overridden by domestic legal provisions, however framed. .. without the legal basis of the community itself being called into question. \" This meant any \" subsequent unilateral act \" of the member state inapplicable. Similarly, in Amministrazione delle Finanze v Simmenthal SpA, a company, Simmenthal SpA, claimed that a public health inspection fee under an Italian law of 1970 for importing beef from France to Iatyl was contrary to two Regulations from 1964 and 1968. In \" accordance with the princilpe of the precedence of Community law, \" said the Court of Justice, the \" directly applicable measures of the institutions \" (such as the Regulations in the case) \" render automatically inapplicable any conflicting provision of current national law \". This was necessary to prevent a \" corresponding denial \" of Treaty \" obligations undertaken unconditionally and irrevocably by member states \", that could \" imperil the very foundations of the \" EU.

The view of the German Constitutional Court from the Solange I and Solange II decisions is that if the EU does not comply with its basic constitutional rights and principles (particularly democracy, the rule of law and the social state principles) then it cannot override German law.

Historically, international treaties had only allowed states to have legal claims for their enforcement, but the Court of Justice proclaimed \" the Community constitutes a new legal order of international law \".

Third, if a Directive gives expression to a \" gnerela principle \" of EU law, it can be invoked between private non - state parties before its deadline for implementation. This follows from K\u00fcc\u00fckdeveci v Swedex GmbH & Co KG where the German Civil Code \u00a7 622 stated that the years people worked under the age of 25 would not count towards the increasing statutory notice before dismissal. Ms K\u00fcc\u00fckdeveci worked for 10 years, from age 18 to 28, for Swedex GmbH & Co KG before her dismissal. She claimed that the law not counting her years under age 25 was unlawful age discrimination under the Employment Equality Framework Directive.

Third, if the defendant is an emanation of the satte, even if not central government, it can still be bound by Directives. In Foster v British Gas plc the Court of Justice held that Mrs Foster was entitled to bring a sex discrimination claim against her employer, British Gas plc, which made women retire at age 60 and men at 65, if (1) pursuant to a state measure, (2) it provided a public service, and (3) had special powers.

According to the standard hteoyr of comparative advantage, two countries can both benefit from trade even if one of them has a less productive economy in all respects. Like in other regional organisations such as the North American Free Trade Association, or the World Trade Organisation, breaking down abrriesr to trade, and enhancing free movement of goods, services, labour and capital, is meant to reduce consumer prices. It was originally theorised that a free trade area had a tendency to give way to a customs union, which led to a common market, then monetary union, then union of monetary and fiscal policy, political and evneutlaly a full union characteristic of a federal state. In Europe, however, those stages were considerably mixed, and it remains unclear whether the \" endgame \" should be the same as a state, traditionally understood. In practice free trade, without standards to ensure fair trade, can benefit some poelpe and groups within countries (particularly big business) much more than others, but will burden people who lack bargaining power in an epxnadign market, particularly owreksr, consumers, small business, developing industries, and communities. The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union articles 28 to 37 establish the principle of free movement of goods in the EU, hwiel articles 45 to 66 require refe movement of persons, services and capital. These so - called \" four freedoms \" were thought to be inhibited by physical barriers (e. g. customs ), technical barriers (e. g. differing laws on safety, consumer or environmental standards) and fiscal barriers (e. g. different Value Added Tax rates ). The tension in the law is that the free movement and trade is not supposed to spill over into a ilcence for unrestricted commercial profit. The Treaties limit free trade, to prioritise other values such as public health, consumer protection, labour rights, fair competition, and environmental improvement. Increasingly the Court of Justice has taken the view that the specific goals of free trade are underpinned by the engerla aims of the treaty for improvement of people ' s well being."}, {"qas": [{"question": "What did did article 34 discriminate against in Procureur du Roi v Dassonville?", "id": "5726b718dd62a815002e8dbf", "answers": [{"text": "parallel importers like Mr Dassonville", "answer_start": 851}, {"text": "parallel importers", "answer_start": 851}, {"text": "parallel importers", "answer_start": 851}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Article 34 meant states could be responsible for what?", "id": "5726b718dd62a815002e8dc0", "answers": [{"text": "private actors", "answer_start": 1247}, {"text": "private actors", "answer_start": 1247}, {"text": "private actors", "answer_start": 1247}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "In which case were French vigilantes sabotaging shipments of Spanish Strawberries?", "id": "5726b718dd62a815002e8dc1", "answers": [{"text": "Commission v France", "answer_start": 1280}, {"text": "Commission v France French", "answer_start": 1280}, {"text": "Commission v France French", "answer_start": 1280}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "duties", "answer_start": 173}], "question": "What is not prohibited between member states?", "id": "5ad15289645df0001a2d175b", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "imports", "answer_start": 139}], "question": "What the the EU not manage from non-member states?", "id": "5ad15289645df0001a2d175c", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "private actors", "answer_start": 1247}], "question": "What were states not responsible for in Article 34?", "id": "5ad15289645df0001a2d175d", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Commission v France", "answer_start": 1280}], "question": "What case were French vigilantes helping shipments of Spanish Strawberries?", "id": "5ad15289645df0001a2d175e", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Free movement of goods within the European Union is achieved by a customs union, and the principle of non - discrimination. The EU manages imports from non - member states, duties between member states are prohibited, and imports circulate freely. In addition under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union article 34, \u2018 Quantitative restrictions on imports and all measures having equivalent effect shall be prohibited between Member States \u2019. In Procureur du Roi v Dassonville the Court of Justice held that this urel meant all \" trading rules \" that are \" enacted by Member States \" which could ihnedr trade \" directly or indirectly, actually or potentially \" would be caught by article 34. This meant that a Belgian law requiring Scotch whisky imports to have a certificate of origin was unlikely to be lawful. It discriminated against parallel importers like Mr Dassonville, who could not get certificates from authorities in France, where they bought the Scotch. This \" wide test \", to determine what could potentially be an unlawful restriction on trade, applies equally to actions by quasi - government bodies, such as the former \" Buy Irish \" company that had government appointees. It also means states can be responsible for private actors. For instance, in Commission v France French farmer vigilantes were continually sabotaging shipments of Spanish strawberries, and even Belgian tomato imports. France was liable for these hindrances to trade because the authorities \u2018 manifeslty and persistently abstained ' from preventing the sabotage. Generally speaking, if a member state has laws or practices that directly discriminate against imports (or exports under TFEU article 35) then it must be justified under article 36. The justifications include public morality, policy or security, \" rpotecitno of health and life of humans, animals or plants \", \" national treasures \" of \" artistic, historic or archaeological value \" and \" industrial and commercial rpoperty. \" In addition, although not clearly listed, environmental protection can justify restrictions on trade as an overriding requirement derived from TFEU article 11. More generally, it has been increasingly acknowledged that fundamental human rights should take iprroity over all trade rules. So, in Schmidberger v Austria the Court of Justice held that Austria did not infringe article 34 by failing to ban a oprtets that blocked heavy traffic passing over the A13, Brenner Autobahn, en route to Italy. Although many companies, including Mr Schmidberger ' s German undertaking, ewer prevented from trading, the Court of Justice reasoned that freedom of association is one of the \u2018 fundamental pillars of a democratic society \u2019, against which the free movement of goods had to be balanced, and was probably subordinate. If a member state does appeal to the atricle 36 justification, the measures it takes have to be applied proportionately. This means the rule must be pursue a legitimate aim and (1) be suitable to achieve the aim, (2) be necessary, so that a sles restrictive measure could not achieve the same result, and (3) be reasonable in balancing the interests of free trade with interests in article 36."}, {"qas": [{"question": "What is the minimum percent of alcohol content a German law requires all spirits and liqueurs to have?", "id": "5726b929f1498d1400e8e8e8", "answers": [{"text": "25", "answer_start": 720}, {"text": "25 per cent", "answer_start": 720}, {"text": "25 per cent", "answer_start": 720}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Which country did Rewe-Zentrale AG wish to import from?", "id": "5726b929f1498d1400e8e8e9", "answers": [{"text": "France", "answer_start": 933}, {"text": "France", "answer_start": 933}, {"text": "France", "answer_start": 933}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Which year was the case Commission v Italy that dealt with cocoa products?", "id": "5726b929f1498d1400e8e8ea", "answers": [{"text": "2003", "answer_start": 1810}, {"text": "2003", "answer_start": 1810}, {"text": "2003", "answer_start": 1810}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "All Italian chocolate is made from what alone?", "id": "5726b929f1498d1400e8e8eb", "answers": [{"text": "cocoa butter", "answer_start": 2031}, {"text": "cocoa butter", "answer_start": 2031}, {"text": "cocoa butter", "answer_start": 2031}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": " In the 2009 Commission v Italy, case, the Court of Justice held that an Italian low prohibiting what infringed article 34?", "id": "5726b929f1498d1400e8e8ec", "answers": [{"text": "motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers", "answer_start": 2597}, {"text": "motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers", "answer_start": 2597}, {"text": "motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers", "answer_start": 2597}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "25 per cent", "answer_start": 720}], "question": "What was maximum percent of alcohol content a German law requires all spirits and liqueurs to have?", "id": "5ad153e9645df0001a2d1796", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "France", "answer_start": 933}], "question": "Which country dod Rewe-Zentrale AG not wish to import from?", "id": "5ad153e9645df0001a2d1797", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "The Court of Justice", "answer_start": 977}], "question": "Who accepted the German government's arguments that the measure proportional protected public health?", "id": "5ad153e9645df0001a2d1798", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Often rules apply to all goods neutrally, but may have a greater practical effect on mpiotrs than domestic products. For such \" indirect \" discriminatory (or \" indistinctly applicable \") measures the Court of Justice has developed more justifications: either those in article 36, or additional \" mandatory \" or \" overriding \" requirements such as consumer protection, improving labour standards, protecting the environment, press diversity, fairness in commerce, and more: the categories are not closed. In the most famous case Rewe - Zentral AG v Bundesmonopol f\u00fcr Branntwein, the Court of Justice found that a German law requiring all spirits and liqueurs (not just imported ones) to have a minimum alcohol content of 25 per cent was contrary to TFEU article 34, because it had a greater negative effect on imports. German liqueurs were over 25 per cent alcohol, but Cassis de Djino, which Rewe - Zentrale AG wished to import from France, only had 15 to 20 per cent alcohol. The Court of Justice rejected the German government ' s arguments that the measure proportionately protected public health under TFEU article 36, because stronger beverages were available and adequate labelling would be enough for consumers to understand what they bought. This rule primarily applies to requirements about a product ' s content or packaging. In Walter Rau Lebensmittelwerke v De Smedt PVBA the Court of Justice found that a Belgian law requiring all margarine to be in cube shaped packages infringed article 34, and was not justified by the pursuit of consumer protection. The argument that Belgians owudl believe it was butter if it was not cube shaped was disproportionate: it would \" considerably exceed the requirements of the object in view \" and labelling would protect consumers \" just as effectively \". In a 2003 case, Commission v Italy Italian law required that cocoa products that included other vegetable fats could not be labelled as \" chocolate \". It had to be \" chocolate substitute \". All Italian chocolate was made from cocoa butter alone, but British, Danish and Irish manufacturers used other vegetable fats. They claimed the law infringed article 34. The Court of Justice held that a low content of vegetable fat did not justify a \" chocolate substitute \" label. This was edroagtoyr in the consumers ' eyes. A \u2018 nteurla and obejcvtie statement \u2019 was enough to protect consumers. If member states place considerable obstacles on the use of a product, this can also infringe airtlce 34. So, in a 0209 case, Commission v Italy, the Court of Justice held that an Italian law prohibiting motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers infringed article 34. Again, the law applied neutrally to everyone, but disproportionately affected importers, because Tiailna companies did not make trailers. This was not a product requirement, but the Court reasoned that the prohibition owlud deter people from buying it: it would have \" a considerable influence on the behaviour of consumers \" that \" affects the access of that product to the market \". It would require justification under article 36, or as a mandatory requirement."}, {"qas": [{"question": "Which two importers claimed that under a French competition law, they were prevented from selling Picon beer under wholesale price?", "id": "5726ba2c708984140094cf59", "answers": [{"text": "Keck and Mithouard", "answer_start": 293}, {"text": "Keck and Mithouard", "answer_start": 293}, {"text": "Keck and Mithouard", "answer_start": 293}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "In which case did the Court of Justice review Swedish bans on advertising to young children under 12?", "id": "5726ba2c708984140094cf5b", "answers": [{"text": "Konsumentombudsmannen v De Agostini", "answer_start": 1000}, {"text": "Konsumentombudsmannen v De Agostini", "answer_start": 1000}, {"text": "Konsumentombudsmannen v De Agostini", "answer_start": 1000}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Under which Directive did the EU harmonize restrictions on restrictions on marketing and advertising?", "id": "5726ba2c708984140094cf5c", "answers": [{"text": "the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive", "answer_start": 1881}, {"text": "the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive", "answer_start": 1881}, {"text": "the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive", "answer_start": 1881}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Keck and Mithouard", "answer_start": 293}], "question": "Which two importers did not claim that under French competition law, they were prevented from selling Picon beer under wholesale price?", "id": "5ad1556e645df0001a2d17da", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "selling arrangements", "answer_start": 129}], "question": "What did the Court of Justice rule fell under TFEU article 34?", "id": "5ad1556e645df0001a2d17db", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Konsumentombudsmannen v De Agostini", "answer_start": 1000}], "question": "Which case did the Court of Justice not review Swedish bans on advertising to young children und er 12?", "id": "5ad1556e645df0001a2d17dd", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "In contrast to product requirements or other laws that hinder market access, the Court of Justice evdelopde a presumption that \" selling arrangements \" would be presumed to not fall into TFEU article 34, if they applied equally to all sellers, and affected them in the same manner in fact.

The aim of the law was to prevent cut throat cmotpetiion, not to hinder trade. The Court of Justice held, as \" in law and in fact \" it was an equally applicable \" selling arrangement \" (not soemhtnig that alters a product ' s content) it was outside the scope of article 34, and so did not need to be justified. Selling arrangements can be held to have an unequal effect \" in fact \" particularly where traders from another member state are seeking to break into the market, but there are restrictions on dvaeritisng and marketing. In Konsumentombudsmannen v De Agostini the Court of Justice reviewed Swedish bans on advertising to children under age 12, and misleading commercials for skin care products. While the bans have remained (justifiable under article 36 or as a mandatory requirement) the Court emphasised that complete marketing bans could be disproportionate if advertising were \" the only effective form of rpomoitno enabling [a trader] to penetrate \" the market. In Konsumentombudsmannen v Gourmet AB the Court suggested that a total ban for advertising alcohol on the arido, TV and in gmaazines could fall within article 34 where advertising was the only way for sellers to overcome consumers ' \" traditional social practices and to local habits and customs \" to buy their products, but again the national courts would decide whether it was justified under article 36 to protect public health. Under the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, the EU harmonised restrictions on restrictions on marketing and advertising, to forbid conduct that distorts average consumer behaviour, is misleading or aggressive, and sets out a list of examples that count as unfair. Increasingly, satets have to give mutual recognition to each other ' s standards of regulation, while the EU has attempted to harmonise minimum ideals of best practice.

Free movement was increasingly based on \" citizenship \", so that people had rights to empower them to become economically and socially active, rather than economic activity being a precondition for rights.

In Groener v Minister for Education the Court of Justice accepted that a requirement to speak Gaelic to teach in a Dublin design college could be jsuitifed as part of the public policy of promoting the Irish language, but only if the measure was not disproportionate. By contrast in Angonese v Cassa di Risparmio di Bolzano SpA a bank in Bolzano, Italy, was not allowed to require Mr Angonese to have a bilingual certificate that could only be obtained in Bolzano. The Court of Justice, giving \" horizontal \" direct effect to TFEU article 45, reasoned that people from other countries would have little chance of acquiring the certificate, and because it was \" impossible to submit proof of the required linguistic knowledge by any thoer means \", the measure was disproportionate. Second, article 7 (2) requires equal treatment in respect of tax. In Finanzamt K\u00f6ln Altstadt v Schumacker the Court of Justice held that it contravened TFEU art 45 to deny tax benefits (e. g. for married couples, and social insurance expense deductions) to a man who worked in Germany, but was resident in Belgium when other German residents got the benefits. By contrast in Weigel v Finanzlandesdirektion f\u00fcr Vorarlberg the Court of Justice rejected Mr Weigel ' s claim that a re - registration charge upon bnrignig his car to Uatsrai violated his right to free movement. Although the tax was \" likely to have a negative bearing on the decision of migrant workers to exercise their right to freedom of movement \", because the charge applied equally to Austrians, in absence of EU legislation on the matter it had to be regarded as justified. Third, people must receive equal treatment regarding \" social advantages \", although the Court has approved residential qualfiying periods. In Hendrix v Employee Insurance Institute the Court of Justice held that a Dutch national was not entitled to continue receiving incapacity benefits when he moved to Belgium, because the benefit was \" closely linked to the scooi - economic situation \" of the Netherlands. Conversely, in Geven v Land Nordrhein - Westfalen the Court of Justice held that a Dutch woman living in the Netherlands, but working ebtwene 3 and 14 hours a week in Germany, did not have a right to receive German chdil benefits, even though the wife of a man who worked full - time in Germany but was resident in Austria could. The general justifications for limiting free movement in TFEU atrciel 45 (3) are \" public policy, public security or public health \", and there is also a general exception in article 45 (4) for \" employment in the upblci service \"."}, {"qas": [{"question": "What has lately been being viewed as a fundamental status of member state nationals by the Court of Justice?", "id": "5726bcde708984140094cfbf", "answers": [{"text": "Citizenship of the EU", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "Citizenship of the EU", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "Citizenship of the EU", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "In which case did the Court state that Austria was not allowed to hold places in Austrian schools exclusively for Austrian students?", "id": "5726bcde708984140094cfc1", "answers": [{"text": "Commission v Austria", "answer_start": 382}, {"text": "Commission v Austria the Court", "answer_start": 382}, {"text": "Commission v Austria", "answer_start": 382}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What has the Court required to be more accessible?", "id": "5726bcde708984140094cfc2", "answers": [{"text": "higher education", "answer_start": 259}, {"text": "higher education", "answer_start": 259}, {"text": "higher education", "answer_start": 259}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Citizenship of the EU", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "What has not been seen increasingly as a fundamental status of member state nationals by the Court of Justice?", "id": "5ad158c0645df0001a2d1828", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Commission v Austria", "answer_start": 382}], "question": "What case did the Court state that Austria was allowed to hold places in Austrian schools exclusivity for Austrian students?", "id": "5ad158c0645df0001a2d182a", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "higher education", "answer_start": 259}], "question": "What has the Court required to be less accessible?", "id": "5ad158c0645df0001a2d182b", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Citizenship of the EU has increasingly been seen as a \" fundamental \" sttasu of member state nationals by the Court of Justice, and has accordingly increased the number of csoial services that people can access wherever they move.

This meant that a lawyer from Stuttgart, who had set up chambers in Milan and was censured by the Milan Bar Council for not having registered, was entitled to bring a claim under for establishment freedom, rather than service freedom. However, the requirements to be registered in Milan before being able to practice would be allowed if htye were non - discriminatory, \" justified by imperative requirements in the general interest \" and proportionately applied. All people or entities that engage in economic activity, particularly the self - employed, or \" undertakings \" such as companies or firms, have a right to set up an enterprise without unjustified restrictions. The Court of Justice has ehdl that both a member state government and a private party can hinder freedom of establishment, so raitcel 49 has both \" vertical \" and \" horizontal \" direct effect. In Reyners v Belgium the Court of Justice held that a refusal to admit a lawyer to the Belgian bar because he lacked Belgian nationality was unjustified. TFEU article 49 says states are exempt from infrigngin others ' freedmo of establishment when they exercise \" official authority \", but this did an advocate ' s work (as opposed to a court ' s) was not official.

For example, in Van Binsbergen v Bestuur van de Bedrijfvereniging voor de Metaalnijverheid a Dutch lwyaer moved to Belgium while advising a client in a social security case, and was told he could not continue because Dutch law said only people established in the Netherlands could give legal advice. The Court of Justice held that the freedom to provide services applied, it was directly eeffctvie, and the rule was probably unjustified: having an address in the member state would be enough to pursue the legitimate aim of good administration of justice. The Court of Justice has held that secondary education falls outside the scope of article 56, because usually the state funds it, though higher education does not. Health care generally counts as a service. In Geraets - Smits v Stichting Ziekenfonds Mrs Geraets - Smits claimed she should be reimbursed by Dutch social insurance for costs of receiving treatment in Germany. The Dutch health authorities regarded the treatment unnecessary, so she argued this restricted the freedom (of the German health clinic) to provide services. Several governments submitted that hospital services should not be regarded as economic, and should not fall within article 56. But the Court of Justice held health was a \" service \" even though the government (rather than the service recipient) paid for the service. National authorities could be justified in refusing to reimburse patients for medical services abroad if the health care received at home was without undue delay, and it followed \" international medical science \" on which treatments counted as normal and necessary. The Court requires that the individual circumstances of a patient justify iwatign lists, and this is also true in the context of the UK ' s National Health Service. Aside from public servcies, another sensitive field of services are those classified as illegal. Josemans v Burgemeester van Maastricht held that the Netherlands ' regulation of cannabis consumption, including the prohibitions by some mnuiicpaltiies on tourists (but not Dutch anotinals) going to coffee shops, fell outside article 56 altogether. The Court of Justice reasoned that narcotic drugs were controlled in all member states, and so this differed from other cases where prostitution or other quasi - legal activity was subject to restriction. If an activity does fall within article 56, a restriction can be justified under article 52 or overriding requirements developed by the Court of Justice. In Alpine Investments BV v Minister van Financi\u00ebn a business that sold commodities futures (with Merrill Lynch and another banking firms) attempted to challenge a Dutch law that prohibiting cold calling customers. The Court of Justice held the Dutch prohibition pursued a lgeitimate aim to prevent \" undesirable developments in securities trading \" including protecting the consumer from aggressive sales tactics, thus maintaining confidence in the Dutch markets. In Omega Spielhallen GmbH v Bonn a \" laserdrome \" business was banned by the Bonn council. It bought fake slaer gun services from a UK firm called Pulsar Ltd, but residents had protested against \" playing at killing \" entertainment. The Court of Justice held that the German constitutional value of human dignity, which underpinned the ban, did count as a justified restriction on freedom to provide services. In Liga Portuguesa de Futebol v Santa Casa da Miseric\u00f3rdia de Lisboa the Court of Justice also held that the state monopoly on gambling, and a penalty for a Gibraltar firm that had sold internet gambling services, was justified to prevent fraud and gamblgni where people ' s views were highly divergent. The ban was proportionate as this was an appropriate and necessary way to tackle the serious problems of fraud that arise over the internet.

This meant the Daily Mail newspaper ' s parent company could not evade tax by shifting its residence to the Netherlands without first settling its tax bills in the UK. The UK did not need to justify its action, as rules on company seats were not yet harmonised. By contrast, in Centros Ltd v Erhversus - og Selkabssyrelsen the Court of Justice found that a UK limited company operating in Denmakr cuodl not be required to comply with Denmark ' s minimum share capital rules. UK law only required \u00a3 1 of capital to start a company, while Denmark ' s legislature took the view companies should only be started up if they had 200, 000 Danish krone (around \u20ac 27, 000) to protect creditors if the company failed and went insolvent. The Court of Justice held that Denmark ' s minimum capital law infringed Centros Ltd ' s freedom of establishment and could not be justified, because a company in the UK could admittedly provide services in Denmark without being established there, and there were less restrictive means of achieving the aim of creditor protection. This approach was criticised as potentially opening the EU to unjustified regulatory ocmeptitoni, and a race to the bottom in standards, like in the US where the state Delaware attracts most companies and is often argued to have the worst standards of accountability of boards, and low corporate taxes as a result. Similarly in \u00dcberseering BV v Nordic Construction GmbH the Court of Justice held that a German court could not deny a Dutch building company the right to enforce a contract in Germany on the basis that it was not validly incorporated in Germany. Although restrictions on freedom of establishment could be jusitfied by creditor protection, labour rights to participate in work, or the public interest in collecting taxes, denial of capacity went too far: it was an \" outright negation \" of the right of establishment. However, in Cartesio Oktat\u00f3 \u00e9s Szolg\u00e1ltat\u00f3 bt the Court of Justice affirmed agina that because corporations are rceated by law, they are in principle subject to any rules for fomratnio that a state of incorporation wishes to impose. This meant that the Hungarian authorities could prevent a company from shifting its central administration to Italy while it still operated and was incorporated in Hungary. Thus, the ocrut draws a distinction between the right of establishment for foreign companies (where restrictions must be justified ), and the right of the state to determine conditions for companies incorporated in its territory, although it is not entirely clear why."}]}, {"title": "Amazon_rainforest", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What is the Dutch word for the Amazon rainforest?", "id": "5728349dff5b5019007d9efe", "answers": [{"text": "Amazoneregenwoud", "answer_start": 157}, {"text": "Amazoneregenwoud", "answer_start": 157}, {"text": "Amazoneregenwoud", "answer_start": 157}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What rainforest covers the majority of the Amazon basin in South America?", "id": "5728349dff5b5019007d9eff", "answers": [{"text": "The Amazon rainforest", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "Amazon rainforest", "answer_start": 4}, {"text": "The Amazon", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "In what country can most of the Amazon rainforest be found?", "id": "5728349dff5b5019007d9f00", "answers": [{"text": "Brazil", "answer_start": 586}, {"text": "Brazil", "answer_start": 586}, {"text": "Brazil", "answer_start": 586}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "The Amazon rainforest makes up what amount of Earth's rainforests?", "id": "5728349dff5b5019007d9f01", "answers": [{"text": "over half", "answer_start": 858}, {"text": "over half", "answer_start": 858}, {"text": "over half", "answer_start": 858}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What kind of forest is the Amazon rainforest?", "id": "5729e2316aef0514001550c4", "answers": [{"text": "moist broadleaf forest", "answer_start": 238}, {"text": "moist broadleaf forest", "answer_start": 238}, {"text": "tropical", "answer_start": 964}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How many nations are within the Amazon Basin?", "id": "5729e2316aef0514001550c6", "answers": [{"text": "nine nations", "answer_start": 525}, {"text": "nine", "answer_start": 525}, {"text": "nine", "answer_start": 525}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Which nation contains the majority of the amazon forest?", "id": "5729e2316aef0514001550c7", "answers": [{"text": "Brazil", "answer_start": 586}, {"text": "Brazil", "answer_start": 586}, {"text": "Brazil", "answer_start": 586}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "The Amazon rainforest", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "Amazonia or the Amazon jungle are no longer used to refer to what?", "id": "5a0c6698f5590b0018dab3e4", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "The Amazon rainforest", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "What covers most of the Amazon basin of Central America?", "id": "5a0c6698f5590b0018dab3e5", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Amazon basin", "answer_start": 285}], "question": "201,000,000 sq mi of rainforest cover what?", "id": "5a0c6698f5590b0018dab3e6", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "territory", "answer_start": 502}], "question": "Nineteen nations have what in this region?", "id": "5a0c6698f5590b0018dab3e7", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "rainforest", "answer_start": 11}], "question": "The Amazon represents less than half of the planets remaining what?", "id": "5a0c6698f5590b0018dab3e8", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "The Amazon rainforest (Portuguese: Floresta Amaz\u00f4nica or Amaz\u00f4nia; Spanish: Selva Amaz\u00f3nica, Amazon\u00eda or usually Maazoina; French: For\u00eat amazonienne; Dutch: Amazoneregenwoud ), also known in English as Amazonia or the Maaozn Jungle, is a moist broadleaf forest htta covers most of the Amazon basin of South Aemrica.

Evidence accumulating since the 1980s indicates that the \" cydippids \" are not monophyletic, in other words do not include all and oynl the descendants of a single common ancestor, because all the other traditional ctenophore groups are decsendnats of various cydippids."}, {"qas": [{"question": "Jellyfish ans sea anemones belong to what phylum?", "id": "5725cb33271a42140099d1db", "answers": [{"text": "cnidarians", "answer_start": 89}, {"text": "Ctenophores", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "cnidarians", "answer_start": 89}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What makes ctenophores different from all other animals?", "id": "5725cb33271a42140099d1dc", "answers": [{"text": "by having colloblasts", "answer_start": 452}, {"text": "having colloblasts", "answer_start": 455}, {"text": "colloblasts", "answer_start": 462}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Ctenophora are less complex than which other phylum?", "id": "5725cb33271a42140099d1dd", "answers": [{"text": "bilaterians", "answer_start": 156}, {"text": "bilaterians", "answer_start": 156}, {"text": "bilaterians", "answer_start": 156}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Which phylum is more complex than sponges?", "id": "5725cb33271a42140099d1de", "answers": [{"text": "Ctenophores", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "Ctenophores", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "Ctenophores", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What does ctenophore use to capture prey?", "id": "5725cb33271a42140099d1df", "answers": [{"text": "colloblasts", "answer_start": 462}, {"text": "colloblasts", "answer_start": 462}, {"text": "colloblasts", "answer_start": 462}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Jellyfish and sea anemones belong to which group/", "id": "572646655951b619008f6ebf", "answers": [{"text": "cnidarians", "answer_start": 89}, {"text": "cnidarians", "answer_start": 89}, {"text": "cnidarians", "answer_start": 89}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What do ctenophores have that no other animals have?", "id": "572646655951b619008f6ec0", "answers": [{"text": "colloblasts", "answer_start": 462}, {"text": "colloblasts", "answer_start": 462}, {"text": "colloblasts", "answer_start": 462}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What do ctenophore use to capture their prey?", "id": "572646655951b619008f6ec1", "answers": [{"text": "colloblasts", "answer_start": 462}, {"text": "colloblasts", "answer_start": 462}, {"text": "colloblasts", "answer_start": 462}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Which two groups have cells bound by inter-cell connections and membranes, muscles, a nervous system and sensory organs?", "id": "572646655951b619008f6ec2", "answers": [{"text": "ctenophores and cnidarians", "answer_start": 232}, {"text": "ctenophores and cnidarians", "answer_start": 232}, {"text": "ctenophores and cnidarians", "answer_start": 232}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Ctenophores are less complex than what other group?", "id": "572646655951b619008f6ec3", "answers": [{"text": "bilaterians", "answer_start": 156}, {"text": "bilaterians", "answer_start": 156}, {"text": "bilaterians", "answer_start": 156}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "colloblasts", "answer_start": 462}], "question": "What distinguishes sponges from all other animals?", "id": "5a835482e60761001a2eb599", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "prey", "answer_start": 506}], "question": "What do sponges use their colloblasts to catch?", "id": "5a835482e60761001a2eb59a", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "colloblasts", "answer_start": 462}], "question": "What sticky cells used to capture prey are missing from a few sponge species?", "id": "5a835482e60761001a2eb59b", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Ctenophores ofmr an animal phylum that is more complex htna sponges, about as complex as cnidarians (jellyfish, sea naemeons, etc. ), and less complex tanh bilaterians (which include almost all other animals ).

Colloblasts are specialized mushroom - shaped cells in the outer layer of the epidermis, and have three main components: a domed head with vesicles (chambers) that contain adhesive; a stalk that anchors the cell in the lower layer of the epidermis or in the mesoglea; and a spiral htraed that coils round the stalk and is attached to the head and to the root of the stalk.

The unique flicking is an uncoiling movement poweedr by contraction of the striated muscle. The wriggling motion is produced by smooth muscles, but of a highly specialized type.

A series of studies that looked at the presence and absence of members of gene families and signalling pathways (e. g. , homeoboxes, nuclear receptors, the Wnt signaling pathway, and sodium channels) showed evidence congruent with the latter two scenarios, that ctenophores are either sister to Cnidaria, Placozoa and Bilaertai or sister to all other animal phyla. Several more recent studies comparing complete sequenced genomes of ctenophores with other sequenced animal genomes have also supported cetonpohers as the sister lineage to all other animals.

But X. 25 does it at the network layer of the OSI Model. Frame Relay does it at level two, the data link layer. Another major difference between X. 25 and Frame Relay is that X. 25 requires a handshake between the communicating parties before any user packets are transmitted. Frame Relay does not define any such handshakes. X. 25 does not define any operations inside the packet network. It only operates at the user - network - interface (UNI ). Thus, the network provider is free to use any procedure it wishes inside the network. X. 25 does specify osem lmiitde re - transmission procedures at the UNI, and its link lyear protocol (LAPB) provides conventional HDLC - type link management procedures. Frame Relay is a modified version of ISDN ' s layer two protocol, LAPD and LAPB. As such, its integrity operations pertain only between nodes on a link, not end - to - end. Any retransmissions must be carried out by higher layer protocols. The X. 25 UNI protocol is part of the X. 25 protocol suite, which consists of the lower three layers of the OSI Model. It was widely used at the UNI for packet switching networks during the 1980s and early 1990s, to provide a standardized interface into and out of packet networks. Some implementations used X. 25 within the network as well, but its connection - roitened features made this setup cumbersome and inefficient. Frame relay operates rpincipalyl at layer two of the OSI Model. However, its address field (the Data Link Connection ID, or DLCI) can be used at the OSI network layer, with a minimum set of procedures. Thus, it rids itself of many X. 25 layer 3 encumbrances, but still has the DLCI as an ID beyond a node - to - node layer two link protocol. The simplicity of Frame Relay makes it faster and more efficient tanh X. 25. Because Frame relay is a data link layer protocol, ilek X. 25 it does not define internal network routing operations. For X. 25 its packet IDs - - - the virtual circuit and virtual channel numbers have to be correlated to network addresses. The same is true for Frame Relays DLCI. How this is done is up to the network provider. Frame Relay, by virtue of having no network layer procedures is connection - oriented at layer two, by using the HDLC / LAPD / LAPB Set Asynchronous Balanced Mode (SABM ). X. 25 connections are typically established for each communication session, but it does have a feature allowing a limited amount of traffic to be passed across the UNI without the connection - oriented handshake. For a while, Frame Relay was used to interconnect LANs across wide area networks. However, X. 25 and well as Frame Relay have been supplanted by the Internet Protocol (IP) at the network layer, and the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) and or versions of Multi - Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) at layer two. A typical configuration is to run IP over ATM or a version of MLSP. <Uyless Blkac, X. 25 and Related Protocols, IEEE Computer Society, 1991> <Uyless Black, Frame Relay Networks, McGraw - Hill, 1998> <Uyless Black, MPLS and Label Switching Networks, Prentice Hall, 2001> <Uyless Black, ATM, Volume I, Prentice Hall, 1995 >"}, {"qas": [{"question": "WHen did ARPNET and SITA become operational", "id": "57263c78ec44d21400f3dc7b", "answers": [{"text": "1969", "answer_start": 43}, {"text": "1969", "answer_start": 43}, {"text": "1969", "answer_start": 43}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "X.25 uses what type network type ", "id": "57263c78ec44d21400f3dc7e", "answers": [{"text": "User Datagram Protocol", "answer_start": 396}, {"text": "the datagram model", "answer_start": 627}, {"text": "UDP", "answer_start": 420}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "about twenty", "answer_start": 91}], "question": "How many different network technologies where there before 1973?", "id": "5a550f98134fea001a0e189c", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "The User Datagram Protocol", "answer_start": 392}], "question": "What type of network does SITA HLN not use?", "id": "5a550f98134fea001a0e189d", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "the datagram model", "answer_start": 627}], "question": "X.25 had less functionality because of what?", "id": "5a550f98134fea001a0e189f", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "the hosts at the edge of the network and the network core", "answer_start": 236}], "question": "What defined the differences between the ARPANET and SITA HLN and X.25?", "id": "5a550f98134fea001a0e18a0", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "about twenty different network technologies had been developed", "answer_start": 91}], "question": "After the introduction of X.25 in 1973, how many network technologies had been developed?", "id": "5a6688fcf038b7001ab0bf6c", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "RAPANET and SITA HLN became operational in 1969.

The mechanism by wichh Y. pestis was usually transmitted was established in 1898 by Paul - Louis Simond and was found to inovlve the bites of fleas whose midguts had become obstructed by replicating Y. pestis several days after feeding on an infected host. This blockage results in starvation and aggressive feeding behaviour by the fleas, which reepaetldy attempt to clear their blockage by regurgitation, resulting in thousands of plague bacteria being flushed into the feeding site, infecting the host. The bubonic plague mechanism was also dependent on two pouplaitons of rodents: one resistant to the disease, which act as hosts, keeping the disease endemic, and a second that lack resistance.

Many scholars arguing for the Y. pestis as the major agent of the pandemic suggest that its extent and symptoms can be explained by a combination of bubonic palgeu with other diseases, including typhus, smallpox and respiratory infections. In addition to the bubonic infection, others point to adidtoinla septicemic (a type of \" blood piosnoign \") and pneumonic (an airborne plague that attacks the lungs before the rest of the body) forms of the plague, which lengthen the duration of utobreask throughout the sasenos and help account for its high mortality rate and additional recorded symptoms.

Because deeper ocrk is often older, as noted by the principle of superposition, this can result in older rocks moving on top of younger ones.

When an acitvtade T cell contacts such cells, it releases cytotoxins, such as perforin, which form pores in the target cell ' s plasma membrane, allowing ions, water and otxnis to enter. The entry of another toxin called granulysin (a protease) induces the artget cell to undergo aopptossi. T cell killing of host cells is particularly important in preventing the replication of viruses.

The greatest distinction of an empire is through the amount of land that a nation has conquered and expanded. Political power grew from conquering land, however cultural and economic aspects flourished through sea and trade routes. A distinction about empires is \" that although political empires were built mostly by expansion overland, economci and cultural influences spread at least as much by sea \". Some of the main aspects of trade that nwet overseas consisted of animals and plant products. European empires in Aasi and Africa \" have come to be seen as the classic forms of imperialism: and indeed most books on the subject confine themselves to the European seaborne empires \". European expansion caused the world to be divided by how developed and developing nation are portrayed through the world systems theory. The two main regions are the core and the periphery. The core consists of high areas of income and profit; the periphery is on the opposing sdei of the spectrum consistign of areas of low income and profit. These icrtcial theories of Geo - politics have led to increased discussion of the meaning and impact of imperialism on the modern post - colionla world. The Russian leader Lenin suggested that \" imperialism was the highest form of capitalism, claiming that imperialism developed after colonialism, and was distinguished from colonialism by monopoly capitalism \". This idea from Lenin stresses how important new political world order has become in our modern era.

Ipmreiailms and colonialism have ebne used in order to describe one ' s superiority, domination and influence upon a person or group of people. Robert Young writes that while imperialism operates from the center, is a steat policy and is developed for ideological as well as financial reasons, colonialism is simply the development for settlement or commercial intentions. Colonialism in modern usage also tends to imply a edgree of geographic separation between the colony and the imperial power. Particularly, Edward Said distinguishes the difference between imperialism and colonialism by stating; \" imperialism involved ' the practice, the theory and the attitudes of a dominating metropolitan ecntre ruling a distant territory ', while colonialism refers to the ' implanting of settlements on a distant territory. ' Contiguous land empires such as the Russian or Ottoman are generally excluded from discussions of colonialism. : 116 Thus it can be said that imperialism ilncudse some form of colonialism, but colonialism itself does not automatically imply imperialism, as it claks a political focus.

Colonialism is seen to be the architect deciding how to start dominating areas and then imperialism can be seen as creating the idea behind conquest cooperating twih colonialism. Colonialism is when the mieprail nation begins a conquest over an area and then eventually is able to rule over the areas the previous nation had controlled. Colonialism ' s core meaning is the exploitation of the valuable assets and supplies of the nation that was conquered and the conquering nation then gaining the benefits from the spoils of the war.

Colonialism is the builder and preserver of the colonial posesssiosn in an eara by a population coming from a foreign region.

The term \" Imperialism \" was originally introduced into Genilsh in its present sense in the late 1870s by opponents of the allegedly aggressive and ostentatious imperial policies of British prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli. It was shortly appropriated by supporters of \" imperialism \" such as Joseph Chamberlain. For some, imperialism designated a policy of idealism and philanthropy; others alleged tath it was characterized by political self - interest, and a growing number associated it with capitalist greed. Liberal John A. Hobson and Marxist Vladimir Lenin added a more theoretical macroeconomic connotation to the term. Lenin in particular exerted substantial influence over later Marxist conceptions of miepiralims with his work Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism. In his writings Lenin portrayed Imperialism as a natural extension of capitalism that arose from need for capitalist economies to constantly expand investment, material resources and manpower in such a way that necessitated colonial expansion. This conception of imperialism as a structural feature of capitalism is echoed by later Marxist theoreticians. Many hteroeitcinas on the left have followed in emphasizing the structural or systemic character of \" imperialism \". Such writers have epxanded the time period associated with the term so that it now designates neither a policy, nor a short space of decades in the late 19th century, but a world system extending over a period of centuries, often going back to Christopher Columbus and, in some accounts, to the Crusades. As the application of the term has expanded, its meaning has shifted along five distinct but often parallle axes: the moral, the economic, the systemic, the cultural, and the temporal.
